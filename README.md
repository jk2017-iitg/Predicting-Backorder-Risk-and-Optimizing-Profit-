Problem statement - A hypothetical manufacturer has a data set that identifies whether or not a backorder has occurred. The challenge is to accurately predict future backorder risk using predictive analytics and machine learning and then to identify the optimal strategy for inventorying products with high backorder risk.

Model used - The training set being an imbalanced dataset wrt to the target variable, the method of synthetic minority oversampling technique was applied so that those 0.25% of products which were getting backorders can be predicted.

Result obtained - AUC of 0.92 was acheived on the test set.
